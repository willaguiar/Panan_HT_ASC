# PananAntarctic simulations with high resolution
Goal: In this project, the main goal is to evaluate how refining the ocean horizontal resolution and better resolving the mesoscale circulation alters the Southern Ocean's heat transport.

- Initial focus was on the heat transport across the continental slope
