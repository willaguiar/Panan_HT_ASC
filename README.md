# Panan-Antarctic simulations with high resolution
**Main goal:** In this project, the main goal is to evaluate how refining the ocean horizontal resolution and better resolving the mesoscale circulation alters the Southern Ocean's heat transport.

*PS: The initial focus was on the heat transport across the continental slope. However, changes in cross-slope heat transport with resolution are quite small, and therefore the focus will likely shift to larger differences offshore*
