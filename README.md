# Panan-Antarctic simulations with high resolution
**Main goal:** In this project, the main goal is to evaluate how refining the ocean horizontal resolution and better resolving the mesoscale circulation alters the Southern Ocean's heat transport.

*PS: The initial focus was on the heat transport across the continental slope. However, changes in cross-slope heat transport with resolution are quite small, and therefore the focus will likely shift to larger differences offshore*


### Summary of current results
- Cross slope heat transport (CSHT):

  - The CSHT seem to have a low sensitivity to refining resolution (https://github.com/willaguiar/Panan_HT_ASC/issues/5), except only in the Dense Shelf Water layer, due to increase dense water formation in higher resolutions
  - The CDW mass exchange across the continental slope increases in finer resolutions as expected, but the upper CDW just off slope also cools down (https://github.com/willaguiar/Panan_HT_ASC/issues/6). This upper CDW cooling compensates the increase in CDW mass exchange, making the CSHT almost insensitive to changes in resolution
 
    
- Offshore changes in heat transport and sea ice:
    - Winter sea ice extent decreases from coarser to finer resolution, reaching close to the observed sea ice extent, and better representing the observed spatial pattern of the sea ice border (https://github.com/willaguiar/Panan_HT_ASC/issues/7#issuecomment-3247416632) <img width="1347" height="367" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/513c596c-5e06-4693-a67d-0cdafc684b1e" />
    - The poleward heat transport increases significantly with resolution offshore, but the differences with resolution get smaller and smaller as we get closer to the continental shelf <img width="3037" height="1228" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83bbf143-130e-4012-89d9-608807205580" />
