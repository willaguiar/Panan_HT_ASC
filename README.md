# Panan-Antarctic simulations with high resolution
**Main goal:** In this project, the main goal is to evaluate how refining the ocean horizontal resolution and better resolving the mesoscale circulation alters the Southern Ocean's heat transport.

*PS: The initial focus was on the heat transport across the continental slope. However, changes in cross-slope heat transport with resolution are quite small, and therefore the focus will likely shift to larger differences offshore*


### Summary of current findings
- Cross slope heat transport (CSHT):
  - The CSHT seem to have a low sensitivity to refining resolution (https://github.com/willaguiar/Panan_HT_ASC/issues/5), except only in the Dense Shelf Water layer, due to increase dense water formation in higher resolutions
  - The CDW mass exchange across the continental slope increases in finer resolutions as expected, but the upper CDW just off slope also cools down (https://github.com/willaguiar/Panan_HT_ASC/issues/6). This upper CDW cooling compensates the increase in CDW mass exchange, making the CSHT almost insensitive to changes in resolution
