# Panan-Antarctic simulations with high resolution
**Main goal:** In this project, the main goal is to evaluate how refining the ocean horizontal resolution and better resolving the mesoscale circulation alters the Southern Ocean's heat transport.

*PS: The initial focus was on the heat transport across the continental slope. However, changes in cross-slope heat transport with resolution are quite small, and therefore the focus will likely shift to larger differences offshore*


### Summary of current findings
 - The Cross-slope heat transport (CSHT) seem to have a low sensitivity to refining resolution (https://github.com/willaguiar/Panan_HT_ASC/issues/5). The only signal we find is that Dense Shelf Water formation pretty much controlss the changes we see in CSHT with resolution
